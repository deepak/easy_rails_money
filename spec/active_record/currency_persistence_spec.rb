# add test that the currency will be serialized in a fixed format
#
# currency (single or otherwise) is always a string
# and it is in smallcase
# because, Money.default_currency.id == "inr".to_sym
#
# previously, single_currency was a Money::Currency object
# whereas some_money_currency was a string object
#
# bugfix: also the currency object was being serialized as a yaml
# which was a bug. facepalm stupid
#
# this was added so that adding validations are easier
# ie. no need to make a case-insensitive check
# and to fix the above bug
#
# not very happy. might want to add typecasts
